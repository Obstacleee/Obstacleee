## About Me
Hi, I'm Lucas — a first-year AI student at IA School and an apprentice application developer at REKA INDUSTRIE (Toulouse, France). Passionate about data, automation, and web technologies, I enjoy building solutions that combine AI, backend, and frontend.

Currently, I work on projects like stock prediction, web scraping, and automating business processes. I’m always eager to learn new tools and collaborate on innovative projects.
